# headless-browser-user-agents
Syntactic patterns of HTTP user-agents used by headless browsers. Pull requests welcome.

*NOTE:* As on 13th June 2019, Chrome Headless is the only browser that identifies itself with a *Headless* signature in its user agent string. Hopefully, other headless browsers will follow suit in future.
